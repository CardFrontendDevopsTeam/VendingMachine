# VendingMachine
Vending Machine Assignment


Solution requirements:
Design and develop a vending machine which vends products based upon four (4) denominations of coins and returns coins if there is no item.
We require you to develop a single page application that does the following:
•	When the application loads, it loads data about all the instances from the products and Coins and visualizes this data in some way. (e.g. A table with all the data)
•	The application must have some mechanism for refreshing all the data from the API without having to reload the entire application (e.g. A refresh data button)
•	The application must have some mechanism for refreshing the data of only a section (products or coins)
•	The application should show the user some indication that it is refreshing/loading new data
 
What we're looking for in a solution:
•	Does it meet the requirements?
•	Does it perform well?
•	How easily could it be extended into a bigger application with a wider API and different resources?
•	Demonstration that the code quality is high (You need to specifically call out at least 4 discrete examples that showcase the quality of your codebase)
•	Can it handle API errors, failing gracefully?
•	Is there any kind of testing?
